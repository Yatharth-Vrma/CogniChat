## Style Guides

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use **ES6+** features where appropriate
- Use **const** and **let** instead of **var**
- Use **arrow functions** for anonymous functions
- Use **template literals** instead of string concatenation
- **Destructure** objects and arrays when possible
- Use **async/await** instead of promises where readable

#### Example:
```javascript
// Good
const getUserData = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('users')
      .select('*')
      .eq('id', userId);
    
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
    return null;
  }
};

// Bad
function getUserData(userId) {
  return supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', userId)
    .then(function(result) {
      return result.data;
    });
}
```

### React Style Guide

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Use **PascalCase** for component names
- Use **camelCase** for prop names
- Extract **custom hooks** for reusable logic
- Use **PropTypes** or TypeScript for type checking

#### Example:
```javascript
// Good
const ChatMessage = ({ message, sender, timestamp }) => {
  const isUser = sender === 'user';
  
  return (
    <div className={`message ${isUser ? 'user-message' : 'ai-message'}`}>
      <p>{message}</p>
      <span className="timestamp">{timestamp}</span>
    </div>
  );
};

// Bad
function ChatMessage(props) {
  return (
    <div className={props.sender === 'user' ? 'user-message' : 'ai-message'}>
      <p>{props.message}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### CSS Style Guide

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes when possible
- Use **CSS modules** or **styled-components** for custom styles
- Follow **BEM methodology** for CSS class names
- Use **semantic HTML** elements
- Ensure **accessibility** compliance

### Git Commit Messages

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples:
```
feat: add voice input functionality
fix: resolve chat persistence issue
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: extract chat logic into custom hook
test: add unit tests for aiService
chore: update dependencies
```
